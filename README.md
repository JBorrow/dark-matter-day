Dark Matter Day
===============

This is the webpage for Dark Matter Day 2017 at Durham University. It's just a
basic webpage outlining where and when the event is; I see no reason not to
open source it as an example of using jinja2 templating.

Feel free to do what you want with the source code. The images will be missing,
of course, but I am sure you will be able to find some of your own to use...
